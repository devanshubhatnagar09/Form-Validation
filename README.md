# Form Validation App with Express and Multer

This is a simple web application built using Express.js for server-side routing, form validation, and Multer for handling multiple file uploads.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Multiple File Upload**: Allow users to upload multiple files simultaneously.
- **Express.js**: Utilize Express.js for handling server-side logic and routing.
- **Multer**: Integrate Multer middleware for processing file uploads.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

- Fill out the form with the required information.
- Upload one or multiple files using the file input field.
- Submit the form to trigger the validation process.
- If validation fails, error messages will be displayed.
- If validation passes, the form data and uploaded files will be processed on the server.

## Dependencies

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer): Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads.

## File Structure

- `public/`: Directory for storing static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript).
- `views/`: Directory for storing view templates (e.g., HTML, EJS).
- `uploads/`: Directory for storing uploaded files (configured in Multer).

## Configuration

- `multer.config.js`: Multer configuration file specifying file upload settings.
- `.env`: Environment configuration file (not included in this sample).
